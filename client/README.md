# Freelance Website Generator (IN PROGRESS)-

This is an educational project for [ECV Digital](https://www.ecv.fr/digital/).  
We should do a personnal project, with free speech.  
Given that I'm doing freelance, I must regulary do some small websites, generaly with the same kind of blocks, design etc.  
This is a website generator. On my backend, I enter the pages I'm wanting, the blocks I want in each pages, and it'll generate me a website.  
To get the API on wich I'm based, go [here]().

## Technical description

The front is done with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). I'd like to have a reusable components logic, but only React wasn't really adapted. Given that it's for real clients, who wants visibility, I'd like to have the more SEO that I can. With NextJS SSR, it was exactly what I was needed.

The back is Strapi. I was interested in Strapi for a while, but hadn't taked the time to test it. That's the perfect project to try.
